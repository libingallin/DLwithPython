    "**从模型的`softmax`输出中进行概率采样是一种巧妙的方法。**甚至可以在某些时候采样到不常见的字符，从而生成看起来更加有趣的句子，而且有时会得到训练数据中没有的、听起来像是真实存在的新单词，从而表现出创造性。但这种方法有一个问题，就是它在采样过程中无法控制随机性的大小。\n",
    "\n",
    "为了在采样过程中控制随机性的大小，引入`softmax temperature`参数，用以表示采样概率分布的熵，即表示所选择的下一个字符会有多么出人意料或多么可预测。更高的temperature得到的是更大的采样分布，会生成更加出人意料、更加无结构的生成数据，更低的temperature对应更小的随机性，以及更加可预测的生成数据。"
